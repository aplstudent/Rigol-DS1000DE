- I am running python 2.7
- Tried to use pyusb to connect to oscilloscope
	- Hit a wall immediately while trying to list connected devices
	- Apparently I need a "backend"
- I know I used pyvisa before, so now I'm trying that.
	- pyvisa is here - https://pyvisa.readthedocs.org/en/stable/index.html
	- it can also be installed through pip
		- pip install pyvisa
	- Must install NI-VISA
		- Support windows and macOS, but only limited linux distros
		- Slightly worried about incompatibility with ubuntu.
- Searching for solutions to the "cannot find backend" problem in pyusb
	- I think pyusb would be the better option if it worked so that we could use it on multiple os's
